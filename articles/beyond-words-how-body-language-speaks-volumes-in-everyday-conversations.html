In fact, research suggests that a large percentage of communication is delivered nonverbally – with tone of voice and body cues conveying much of the message alongside words. While oft-cited figures come with caveats, they underscore a powerful point: body language heavily shapes how we understand each other in everyday interactions. From a friend’s raised eyebrow to a coworker’s crossed arms, these signals constantly color our perceptions of trust, warmth, and clarity.</p><p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:419">Consider first impressions: we form them fast. In a classic experiment, students who watched just short, silent video clips of a teacher formed ratings of the teacher’s competence that strongly correlated with the opinions of actual students who’d been in class all semester. Our brains zero in on facial expressions, gestures, and posture almost instantly, extracting social meaning before a single word is understood.</p><p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:512">Why does this matter for daily life? Because in casual chats with friends, hallway talks at work, or chance encounters, your body language may speak louder than your words. Below, we explore findings on how nonverbal cues – eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, posture, personal space, and more – impact understanding, trust, and rapport. We’ll also highlight real studies with data (not just gut feeling) and share tips on leveraging body language, especially if you’re learning a new language or culture.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:39">How Much of Communication Is Nonverbal?</h2><p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:519">It’s tempting to put a number on the influence of body language. You may have heard that a significant portion of communication is body language, stemming from studies of emotional expression. In context, that research by Albert Mehrabian and others meant that when we express feelings or attitudes, visual cues (body language) and vocal tone far outweigh literal words in conveying true intent. If someone says “I’m fine” but their slumped posture and flat tone say otherwise, we tend to believe the nonverbal message.</p><p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:523">Modern behavioral science affirms that nonverbal signals are critical, but they work in concert with words. For example, psychologists find that hand gestures are tightly integrated with speech – many gestures happen while talking, helping speakers find the right words and listeners grasp the content. In other words, gestures aren’t just add-ons; they actively enhance clarity and understanding. Body language provides context for language, often conveying what words cannot: sincerity, confidence, confusion, or emotion.</p><p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:374">Key takeaway: Nonverbal cues often carry the emotional and interpersonal weight of a message. Words matter (especially for facts and explicit content), but tone, facial expressions, and body posture give those words their full meaning. Paying attention to these signals can drastically improve your comprehension – and help ensure your intended message lands as you mean it.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="17:1-17:28">Eyes, Contact, and Attention</h2><p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:626">The eyes are famously called the “window to the soul,” and science shows eye contact is a powerful social glue – but perhaps not in the way we assume. You might expect that people in conversation stare into each other’s eyes constantly. Surprisingly, a recent study using eye-tracking found that during face-to-face chats, people’s gazes align infrequently, and direct eye-to-eye contact occurs only a small percentage of the time. In other words, continuous mutual gaze is rare in natural conversation. We actually spend a lot of time looking away – at our surroundings, or letting our eyes drift while we formulate thoughts.</p><p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:554">Importantly, though infrequent, those moments of true eye contact seem to really matter. The same study showed that even brief eye-to-eye connections predicted better social alignment: pairs who made more direct eye contact were more likely to follow each other’s gaze to points of interest and achieve mutual understanding. Just a few seconds of warm eye contact can signal “I’m with you,” building trust and rapport. In everyday terms, catching someone’s eye and sharing a genuine look may help sync up your minds, indicating attentiveness and empathy.</p><p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:600">That said, more eye contact isn’t always better in every context. Another study in a medical setting found an unexpected result: doctors who gazed more steadily at patients’ faces were rated as less trustworthy by those patients. Why would more eye contact lower trust? Researchers theorized that intense staring might feel intrusive or be used in serious conversations (e.g. delivering bad news), thus associating greater gaze with discomfort. This reminds us that effective eye contact is about quality, not sheer quantity. A warm, responsive gaze can reassure, but unbroken staring can intimidate.</p><p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:546">Cultural tip: Eye contact norms vary widely. In some cultures (like the U.S.), looking someone in the eye signals confidence and honesty; in others (e.g. Japan or parts of the Middle East), prolonged eye contact may be seen as disrespectful or aggressive. Language learners should observe local norms – you might need to meet eyes more directly or, conversely, soften your gaze to fit in. For example, if you notice locals glance away frequently when listening, don’t assume they’re uninterested – it may be a sign of politeness or concentration.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="27:1-27:28">Facial Expressions and Trust</h2><p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:748">Our faces can flash a world of emotion in an instant – joy, concern, skepticism, you name it. Facial expressions are a universal language to a degree, but they’re also nuanced by context and culture. A genuine smile, however, is one cue that seems to cross borders and strongly impact trust. Researchers have shown that a smile which is perceived as honest and genuine (a so-called Duchenne smile, reaching the eyes) literally “builds trust” in social interactions. In one experiment, people who smiled sincerely were more often trusted in an investment game, and they proved more cooperative as partners. In short, a real smile not only makes you seem friendlier – it often signals you are friendlier, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of goodwill.</p><p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:737">On the flip side, most of us can spot a fake smile if we look carefully. (Is the smile just mouth, not eyes? Does it vanish quickly?) We tend to – rightly – trust those less. Psychology writers note that people consistently rate smiling faces as more honest, likable, and approachable than neutral ones. We’re wired to respond positively to positive expressions. But if something feels “off” – say, a tense grin – we get a gut feeling that the person might be hiding something or insincere. Interestingly, studies find that genuine smiles occur more often when stakes are high and the smiler truly means to cooperate. Because genuine smiling uses muscles we don’t control consciously as easily, it’s a fairly reliable signal of goodwill.</p><p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:641">Of course, not all meaningful facial cues are as obvious as a smile. Eyebrows and micro-expressions play a role too. A quick furrow of the brow can signal confusion; a slight head tilt with raised eyebrows says “tell me more.” Researchers examining split-second “microexpressions” (tiny facial movements that flash by quickly) have found they do occur, but they are rare in everyday life. So while trained observers might fixate on those fleeting cues, for most of us it’s the more sustained expressions that communicate volumes. A relaxed, open expression vs. a clenched jaw and narrowed eyes can entirely change the tone of an interaction.</p><p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:682">Lesson for language learners: When navigating a new culture, pay attention to what’s considered a friendly or polite expression. For example, in many East Asian cultures, people may smile or laugh not just when happy, but sometimes to mask discomfort or embarrassment – a nuance that can confuse outsiders. Conversely, some cultures use fewer overt facial expressions in public; a straight face might not mean someone is cold or angry. As you learn the spoken language, also learn the “facial language” – it will help you read between the lines of conversation. And don’t underestimate your facial signals: a sincere smile and attentive look go a long way to bridging language gaps.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="37:1-37:45">Gestures and Posture in Everyday Interactions</h2><p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:744">Think about how you naturally move when you talk with a friend. Do your hands animate the story? Do you nod along to show you’re listening? These gestures and postural cues are the scaffolding of our conversations, often subconsciously orchestrated to help ideas flow. Modern research confirms that gesturing isn’t just theatrical flair – it’s linked to clearer communication and even cognition. Psychologists have found that people gesturing as they speak tend to find words more easily and convey ideas more effectively. For listeners, seeing a speaker’s hands outline a concept (big vs. small, this idea vs. that one) can make the message more memorable. In everyday life, a thumbs-up, a wave, or a shrug can be as informative as a sentence.</p><p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:1052">Our posture and body orientation send messages, too, often picked up instinctively. For example, an open posture – facing someone, arms uncrossed, head up – signals receptivity and friendliness. In contrast, closed posture – turned away, arms folded, shoulders hunched – can imply defensiveness or disinterest. In a neat experiment on first impressions, researchers created scenarios with actors using approach body language (open arms, moving toward the person, smiling) versus avoidance body language (arms crossed, leaning away, a grimace). Not surprisingly, the “approach” postures made observers rate the person much more positively. But here’s the kicker: they also tested the effect of a handshake in these scenarios. When a friendly handshake was added, it boosted positive impressions in the open posture case and even softened the negative impressions in the closed posture case. In other words, a simple handshake at the start of an interaction significantly increased warmth and even helped overcome an initially awkward or chilly demeanor.</p><p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:448">The power of a handshake has even been measured in brain scans. One study found that adding a handshake activated reward centers in the brain and led to higher ratings of trustworthiness in a social exchange. It appears this age-old gesture – a sign of “I come in peace” – truly does set a cooperative tone. (Even in our pandemic-era where handshakes are less common, their impact is worth noting for situations where they are culturally expected.)</p><p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:605">Beyond handshakes, think of everyday gestures that build understanding: nodding your head while someone else speaks (a sign of “I’m following” or agreement), using your hands to paint a picture (“the fish was this big!”), or mirroring a friend’s casual posture to signal camaraderie. Each of these can reinforce the verbal message or, at times, replace it entirely. If a colleague asks, “Everything clear?” you might give a quick thumbs-up or an OK 👌 sign – no words needed. Visual learners especially appreciate when a speaker’s body language aligns with their speech, as it gives two channels of input.</p><p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:513">Practical tip: To appear more credible and approachable, try to maintain an open posture and use purposeful gestures. Research in communication shows that speakers who gesture naturally and keep a welcoming stance are often seen as more competent and trustworthy. For instance, keeping your palms visible and facing upward can nonverbally say “I have nothing to hide” – a cue of honesty. Just be sure your gestures complement what you’re saying; random or excessive fidgeting might distract or signal nervousness.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="49:1-49:45">Synchrony: The Chameleon Effect and Mirroring</h2><p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:568">Have you ever noticed friends start to mirror each other’s movements – sitting in similar positions, picking up each other’s slang, even sipping coffee in unison? Humans are natural copycats (within limits), and this subtle mirroring plays a big role in bonding. Psychologists call it the Chameleon Effect: we unconsciously mimic the gestures, postures, and even tone of people we like or are trying to get along with. This isn’t deception; it’s a built-in social glue that makes interactions feel smoother. By “speaking the same body language,” we signal affiliation.</p><p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:1058">Recent research shows just how powerful this mirroring can be – and that it even transcends physical distance. A 2023 study examined whether people synchronize their body language over video calls (think Zoom meetings) as much as in person. The researchers had participants interact in three scenarios: face-to-face, via a live video chat, and watching a pre-recorded video (no real interaction). In each, a confederate intentionally performed behaviors like yawning or touching their face. The findings were striking: in the live video and in-person conditions, people mimicked the behaviors at similar rates, far more than those who only watched a one-way recording. In other words, our bodies synchronize almost as much through a screen as they do in person. Simply knowing there’s someone truly “there” in real time triggers our mirroring instinct. (Interestingly, when the confederate repeatedly yawned or scratched – behaviors that can signal boredom – trust levels in the interaction dropped slightly, suggesting there are limits to positive mimicry.)</p><p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:591">Beyond conscious gestures, our bodies can sync up in more subtle ways. Eye blinks and even heartbeats can fall into rhythm when people have a strong rapport. Researchers have found that when two people are deeply engaged in conversation, their pupil dilations and gaze patterns start to synchronize, reflecting a kind of shared attention. Think of two friends in animated discussion, eyes locked at moments of mutual excitement – their nonverbal signals rise and fall together. This physiological mirroring is a sign of minds “clicking.” It’s the science behind feeling in sync with someone.</p><p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:809">Takeaway: Small mirroring behaviors – a slight adoption of your conversation partner’s posture, using a similar tone, or matching their energy level – can foster a sense of “we’re on the same page.” It’s usually not even intentional. In fact, if you try too hard to deliberately mirror someone, it can backfire (coming off as mockery or just feeling awkward). The key is to be natural: active listening often automatically leads you to mirror a bit. As you nod and lean in, they nod and lean in. This comfortable dance of body language makes both parties feel understood. For language learners, being aware of local gestures to mirror can help – for instance, matching the common greeting (a bow, a handshake, a cheek kiss) or echoing a conversational partner’s polite nods can signal respect for their norms.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="59:1-59:27">The Role of Space and Touch</h2><p data-sourcepos="61:1-61:254">Communication isn’t just about what we say and how we move, but also where we stand in relation to others. The distance we keep or the touch we share speaks volumes about our comfort and intent. This falls under proxemics – the science of personal space.</p><p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:860">Studies have documented big cultural differences in preferred personal distances. For example, some cultures tend to stand quite close during casual interactions, while others prefer a wider distance. Neither is right or wrong – it’s a cultural norm. In Latin America or the Middle East, you might notice people stand or sit quite close to friends, frequently touching shoulders or arms while conversing, which conveys warmth and involvement. In contrast, Northern Europeans or East Asians might maintain a larger “bubble” of space, seeing it as respectful. Understanding these unspoken rules can be crucial for someone trying to fit into a new culture. Misreading them can lead to discomfort: a person used to wide personal space may feel intruded upon by close talkers, while someone from a contact culture might feel a more distant partner is cold or aloof.</p><p data-sourcepos="65:1-65:742">One fascinating analysis noted that across many cultures, personal space “bubbles” may have expanded in recent years, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased digital communication. People worldwide reported keeping more distance from strangers post-pandemic compared to before. Even among friends and family, average comfortable distances seemed to grow. This shift suggests that norms are not static – they adapt to societal changes and collective experiences. If you’re traveling or learning a language, it’s wise to stay attuned: what was customary a few years ago might be slightly different now (for instance, handshakes or hugs might be less automatic than they once were, depending on local post-pandemic attitudes).</p><p data-sourcepos="67:1-67:768">Touch is another potent nonverbal cue. A light touch on the arm or a pat on the back can convey warmth, reassurance, or solidarity. In everyday interactions, appropriate touch often builds goodwill. A simple example: tipping behavior. Studies found that restaurant servers who briefly touched a customer on the shoulder or hand while returning change earned significantly higher tips. The touch (only a second or two) made customers feel more personally attended to, without them even realizing why, resulting in greater generosity. Similarly, research showed that a bartender’s light touch on a patron’s arm increased the likelihood that the patron would leave a tip at all. These findings underline how touch can create positive feelings and trust when it’s welcome.</p><p data-sourcepos="69:1-69:315">Of course, context and consent are critical. The same casual touch that’s friendly in one scenario could be inappropriate in another. A warm hug between close friends might be normal, but hugging your new coworker might cross a boundary. Always gauge the other person’s comfort (when in doubt, less touch is safer).</p><p data-sourcepos="71:1-71:589">For those learning intercultural communication: learn the local greeting rituals. Does your new culture favor handshakes, bows, cheek kisses, or simply a verbal hello with no contact? Adapting to that speaks respect. Also, be mindful of gestures that are benign at home but offensive elsewhere (for instance, the “OK” hand sign is friendly in the US but rude in some countries, and showing the soles of your feet is taboo in others). These nuances of space and touch are part of the language that doesn’t appear in textbooks but can significantly impact how your interactions are received.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="73:1-73:45">Navigating Cultural Body Language Differences</h2><p data-sourcepos="75:1-75:447">When immersing yourself in a new language environment, words are just one part of the puzzle. Local body language norms – how close people stand, how they use eye contact, how much they gesture, how they express emotion – are the often overlooked second part of achieving true communication fluency. A gesture or expression that feels natural to you might puzzle or even offend someone from another culture, even if your spoken grammar is perfect.</p><p data-sourcepos="77:1-77:642">For example, head movements for “yes” and “no” can literally flip meanings across cultures. In Bulgaria (and some neighboring regions), a nod actually means “no,” and a head shake means “yes.” Imagine the potential confusion for an unaware traveler or language student! If you ask a Bulgarian host if they liked the meal and they nod, you’d misread their polite disagreement as approval. Knowing these quirks can save you from serious miscommunication. Likewise, pointing with your index finger is common in the West, but in Japan it’s more polite to gesture with an open hand, and using a finger might be considered a bit rude or too direct.</p><p data-sourcepos="79:1-79:748">Facial etiquette differs too. In some East Asian cultures, a lack of constant smiling in service settings isn’t unfriendliness – it’s just a more reserved demeanor. Meanwhile, Latin Americans or Mediterraneans might express emotions more overtly with their faces and hands during conversation – passion that a Scandinavian might misread as anger if they didn’t know better. The key is to observe and, when appropriate, ask questions. People generally appreciate a respectful curiosity about their customs. You might say, “I notice people stand a lot closer here when chatting – is that the norm? I’m still getting used to it.” Such a comment can be a cultural exchange moment (and more often than not, locals will reassure you kindly or give tips).</p><p data-sourcepos="81:1-81:307">In short, every culture has its own body language “dialect.” Learning it can be just as important as learning verb conjugations. It can help you avoid awkward moments like going for a handshake when the other person is bowing, or speaking at a volume that’s normal to you but too loud for the local context.</p><h2 data-sourcepos="83:1-83:43">Practical Tips for Harnessing Body Language</h2><p data-sourcepos="85:1-85:171">In light of the research and examples above, what can you do to communicate better in everyday life? Here are some practical, research-backed takeaways to put into action:</p><ol data-sourcepos="87:1-93:0"><li data-sourcepos="87:1-87:305">Make eye contact, but not staring contact: Aim to meet the other person’s eyes during key points (like greetings or when emphasizing sincerity), but don’t worry about holding it unblinkingly. Natural breaks in gaze are normal. Maintain a balance that shows attentiveness without giving a “hard stare.”</li><li data-sourcepos="88:1-88:403">Smile genuinely when you feel it: A real smile can be felt (crinkling around the eyes, relaxed cheeks) and can instantly set a friendly tone. As research shows, honest smiles foster trust. Don’t force a fake grin the whole time – that can seem insincere – but do let your warmth show on your face. If you’re happy to see someone or find something amusing, smile! It’s a universal signal of goodwill.</li><li data-sourcepos="89:1-89:444">Use open and engaged posture: Face the person you’re talking to, keep your arms uncrossed and relaxed, and nod or lean forward slightly when they’re speaking to show interest. These cues make you appear more approachable and empathetic. If you tend to slouch or shove hands in pockets out of habit, be mindful to “open up” a bit – it can make others feel more at ease. An open posture is basically a nonverbal way of saying “I’m receptive.”</li><li data-sourcepos="90:1-90:531">Mind your hand gestures (and use them to help, not hinder): Let your hands complement your words. Simple gestures like pointing to an object you’re discussing, using your fingers to count off items, or miming an action can reinforce understanding. Just avoid excessive fidgeting or erratic gestures that don’t match your speech, as that can confuse your message. If you’re explaining something complex, sometimes drawing in the air or shaping a concept with your hands actually helps both you and the listener conceptualize it.</li><li data-sourcepos="91:1-91:465">Mirror moderately for rapport: You don’t need to consciously imitate every move, but being “in sync” helps. If your friend takes a relaxed pose, you can ease into a similar one. If they speak softly and calmly, matching that tone (without mocking) can make them feel understood. Subtle mirroring of body language often happens naturally when conversation flows well. If you notice it, it’s usually a good sign! Just be authentic; forced mirroring is noticeable.</li><li data-sourcepos="92:1-93:0">Respect personal space and touch boundaries: When you first meet someone, err on the side of a bit more personal space until you gauge their comfort. In many Western contexts, about an arm’s length is a safe starting distance for acquaintances. As you build familiarity, you’ll sense if you can stand closer or use casual touches like a pat on the arm. Always consider cultural norms: if you’re in a country where cheek-kissing is a standard greeting among friends, it’s polite to learn how it’s done. Conversely, if you’re somewhere where even handshakes are not common (or in a pandemic-aware situation), don’t force contact. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with a friendly wave or nod at first meeting. And remember, “no” means “no” in body language too – if someone leans or steps away, or doesn’t reciprocate a touch, take the cue and give them space.</li></ol><p data-sourcepos="94:1-94:360">By being mindful of these nonverbal elements, you’ll likely find your conversations become smoother and richer. You’ll pick up on unspoken concerns (“You say you’re okay, but I sense something’s bothering you”) and you’ll be able to project confidence and empathy even when you’re searching for the right words (crucial for language learners in mid-sentence!).</p><h2 data-sourcepos="96:1-96:44">Conclusion: Communication as a Whole Package</h2><p data-sourcepos="98:1-98:520">Interpersonal communication is more than the sum of its verbal parts. Words deliver content, but body language delivers context, emotion, and nuance. The most innovative recent research – from eye-tracking studies to neuroscience of gestures – only reinforces how entwined our minds and bodies are in communicating. We’ve seen that a mere handshake can soften conflict, a genuine smile can win cooperation, a brief lock of eyes can signal synchrony, and a respectful distance (or closeness) can make someone comfortable.</p><p data-sourcepos="100:1-100:472">For those learning new languages, remember that you’re also learning new ways of being in conversation. It’s okay to feel a bit like an actor at first, adjusting your bows, handshakes, or eye contact to the local script. With time, these nonverbal cues will become an effortless part of your communication style in that language. You’ll joke that you have different personalities in different languages – and in a sense, you do, because the nonverbal “you” adapts as well.</p><p data-sourcepos="102:1-102:738">In everyday life, being aware of body language—both others’ and your own—acts like a social superpower. It lets you listen better (since you’re not just hearing words, but seeing feelings) and express yourself more fully. And it’s a two-way street: as you project positive, open body language, you often invite the same in return, creating a virtuous cycle of trust and clarity. So next time you’re chatting with a friend or making a new acquaintance, think of it as speaking with your whole self. Your posture, your eyes, your facial expressions are all part of the dialogue. Mastering this unspoken language can transform not just conversations, but relationships – helping ensure that what you mean to say is exactly what comes across.</p></div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flanguizy.com%2Farticles%2Fbeyond-words-how-body-language-speaks-volumes-in-everyday-conversations.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Flanguizy.com%2Farticles%2Fbeyond-words-how-body-language-speaks-volumes-in-everyday-conversations.html&amp;via=Languizy&amp;text=Beyond%20Words%3A%20How%20Body%20Language%20Speaks%20Volumes%20in%20Everyday%20Conversations" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://languizy.com/about" class="al" title="About Languizy" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://languizy.com/privacy-policy" class="al" title="Privacy Policy" target="_self">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://languizy.com/terms-of-service" class="al" title="Terms of Service" target="_self">Terms of Service</a></li><li><a href="https://languizy.com/contact" class="al" title="Contact Us" target="_self">Contact Us</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Languizy 2024 - All Rights Reserved</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Languizy/" aria-label="Facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://x.com/LanguizyAI" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://languizy.com/articles/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
